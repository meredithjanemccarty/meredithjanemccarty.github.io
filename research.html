    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The overall theme of my research concerns how the interplay between specialization and 
      generalizability in population-level neural activity supports flexible cognition. 
      Overarching interests include attention, sensory perception, and consciousness.
    </p>
    <div class="divider"></div>

  <section>
    <h2>Experimental Research</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout my PhD and postdoctoral studies, I have examined the electrophysiological basis
      of flexible cognition in humans using intracranial EEG (iEEG) methods (sEEG, SDE, and single-unit recordings),
      scalp EEG, cortical stimulation mapping, as well as DBS and RNS recordings. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A consistent interest of mine is understanding the limits of tools available to study the brain,
      and to <b>clarify how neural representations are linked across these spatial scales</b>. In science, our
      understanding is constrained by the limits of our tools which define how we can quantify neural phenomenon.
      In this vein, I have validated several assumptions about the locality of iEEG signals and clarified how
      electrode type, referencing scheme, and filtered frequency influence electrode listening zone 
      <a href="https://www.eneuro.org/content/9/2/ENEURO.0492-21.2022">McCarty et al., 2022</a>. These findings
      experimentally validate lab-standard analyic methods used to ascribe recorded neural activity to cortical space. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a combination of ECoG and cortical stimulation mapping during an awake craniotomy, I revealed a
      mosaic of broadband gamma activation (BGA) for music and language within the superior temporal gyrus 
      <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004223013007">McCarty et al., 2023</a>. 
      Beyond ECoG analyses alone, stimulation mapping provided a degree of causal evidence for a mosaic of
      necessity of different high-order auditory regions in either music or language perception or production. 
      These findings indicate <b>shared neural resources for language and music comprehension in high-order auditory cortex,
       alongside domain-specific specialization for their respective structural features</b>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My current research investigates flexible attention, or the prioritization of relevance information
      and filtering out of distractors. (McCarty et al., in prep). Using iEEG data collected from 31 subjects,
      I have implemented analyses of local BGA dynamics and inter-areal directed communication to reveal
      how high-order sensory regions within the ventral occipitotemporal cortex support flexible attention to 
      visual objects. These findings provide novel insight into <b>how dynamics within high-order sensory and 
      frontoparietal attentional networks support adaptive, goal-directed behavior</b>.

    <h2>Theoretical Research</h2>
    <p>
      My theoretical research has developed in several directions, alongside my experimental work. 
      Before beginning my PhD studies, I developed an interest in thalamo-cortical circuitry while working as a 
      research assistant in Dr. Audrey Brumback's <a href="https://www.brumbacklab.org/">Autism and Neurodevelopment Lab</a>. 
      I developed a theoretical project linking first-person reports and clinical findings with basic neuroanatomy and physiology
      to better understand stereotypies, or semi-voluntary repetitive movements that are a prominent clinical feature of autism spectrum disorder. 
      I generated novel testable hypotheses that <b>stereotypies improve sensory processing and attention by regulating brain rhythms, either directly from
       the rhythmic motor command, or via rhythmic sensory feedback generated by the movements </b>
      <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071909121000255">(McCarty & Brumback, 2021)</a>. This project exemplifies 
      my interest in interdisciplinary and theoretical work, integrating research from different methodologies and model systems to better understand a common topic. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am very interested in developing clear theoretical frameworks for incorporating single-unit human data alongside local field potential recordings 
      to understand cognitive processes. Without a strong theoretical foundation explaining why neural dynamics should encode information at different scales, 
      there is a risk of erroneously conflating correlation with true representational clarity. <b>The central question remains as to whether different neural correlates
      reflect genuine coding mechanisms the brain uses to represent information</b>. While prior reserach has found numerous cognitive processes to be interpreted at an 
      LFP level in humans, I am eager to continue clarifying this representational format of information present at the scale of LFP recordings and beyond. 
    </p>

    <h2>Future Research</h2>
    <p>
      I view attention to be linked to the subjective experience of conscious awareness, and seek to identify the neural dynamics underlying this process
       in my ongoing and future research. I am drawn to theories of how 
      <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4605134/"> neural synchrony</a> and 
      <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30591373/"> rhythmic dynamics</a> coordinate increased attention and conscious
       processing in the brain. As such, I am very interested in studying altered states of consciousness, be that natural sleep, anaesthetized states, 
      or disorders of consciousness. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This interest extends to predictive processing frameworks, especially when considering how the energetic constraints of neural design may shape neural dynamics. 
      I am especially interested in network models incorporating 
      <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-023-00756-z"> thalamo-cortical dynamics</a>, especially when considering gating mechanisms for what sensory or cognitive information
       reaches awareness in consicous and unconscious states. Overall, I am interested in understanding how emergent network dynamics support 
      flexible cognition across brain states.
